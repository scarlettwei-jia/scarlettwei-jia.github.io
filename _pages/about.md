I am a [Biomedical Engineering Ph.D. student at Johns Hopkins University](https://www.bme.jhu.edu), working under the guidance of [Dr. Katsuyuki “Ken” Taguchi](https://profiles.hopkinsmedicine.org/provider/ken-taguchi/2777799) in the Radiological Physics Division of the Russell H. Morgan Department of Radiology and Radiological Science. My research focuses on developing algorithms for photon counting CT, leveraging spectral information, and improving image quality at low radiation doses. After completing my Ph.D., I plan to apply for a medical physics residency in radiation oncology.

Prior to joining the Ph.D. program, I graduated summa cum laude with a B.S. in Biomedical Engineering and a minor in Computational Physics from [Union College, N.Y](https://www.union.edu/ecbe/biomedical-engineering). During my undergraduate studies, I worked on a variety of projects with a focus on data analysis, including evolutionary algorithm-based soft robotics movement analysis, photon counting CT evaluation, meson decay analysis with the GlueX project, and developing an MRI preprocessing pipeline.
